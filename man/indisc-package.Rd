\title{
A unified approach for obtaining and estimating unidimensional Item Response Theory (IRT) Dual Models (DMs)
}
\description{
Package consisting on a main function (\code{\link{InDisc}}) that calls all the sub-functions that implement the procedures described in Ferrando (2019) for fitting binary, graded, and continuous response DMs. Estimation is based on a two stage (calibration and scoring) random-regressors approach (McDonald, 1982). Item calibration at the first stage is the same as in the corresponding standard IRT models, is based on a factor-analytic Underlying-Variables approach, and uses an unweighted least squares, (ULS) minimum-residual criterion as implemented in the \code{\link{psych}} R package (Revelle, 2018). Individual trait scores and individual discriminations are obtained at the second stage using Expected a Posteriori (EAP) Bayes estimation. Overall, the combined ULS-EAP estimation procedure is simple, robust, and can handle large datasets, both in terms of sample size and test length.
